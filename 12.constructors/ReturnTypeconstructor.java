    // Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.
    // They do not have a return type, not even void.
    // Constructors are called when an object of a class is created.
    // They are used to set initial values for object attributes.
    // Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

    // Incorrect: Constructor with a return type (Java does not allow this!)

//If you try to give a return type to a constructor, it becomes a method, not a constructor.
